Language Technical Comparison
=============================

HTML source code to use as a template for multiple language evaluations.

-   Although the checkboxes intentionally restrict the results, the set of ORed
    (**\|**) options are simply meant to frame the descriptions and make it
    clearer what I intend to be described. Feel free to choose one of the
    options or to use them as a jumping-off point for a written description.

Suggestions welcome via [issue
report](<https://github.com/BruceEckel/Language-Evaluation-Checklist/issues>) or
pull request.
